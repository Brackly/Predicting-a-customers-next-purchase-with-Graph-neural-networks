*Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)* leverage message passing (Zhong et al., 2021) as a diffusion mechanism. In our scenario, we have a graph where customer nodes are connected to the products they have purchased. Through message passing, the customer nodes collect information from the product nodes and incorporate it into their own representations. Consequently, each product node obtains information about every customer who bought it.

By aggregating information from the products they have purchased, the customer nodes create representations that reflect their purchase history, including the products they bought and the circumstances in which they bought them. Similarly, the product nodes aggregate information about the customers who bought them. These representations encode valuable patterns and relationships between customers and products.

To predict whether a customer will buy a specific product, we can employ a prediction mechanism such as a dot product between the customer node and the product node representations. The dot product yields a probability score, indicating the likelihood of the customer purchasing the product. A higher score suggests a higher probability of purchase, while a lower score suggests a lower probability.

It is important to note that the actual implementation of the prediction process may involve additional steps, such as applying activation functions, utilizing trainable parameters, and employing appropriate loss functions for model training. The dot product serves as a component within the broader framework of a GNN-based prediction model.

Leveraging graphs' ability to capture complex relationships between nodes and their interactions through message passing, we can provide a good basis to solve the cold start problem. Since each product node collects information from the customers that purchased it, it is able to learn what types of customers typically buy the product. If we, therefore, perform a dot product between a new customerâ€™s feature vectors and the product feature vectors, the similarities. if any, between customers that bought the product and the new customer play a role in increasing the probability of the customer buying the product.
